A full stack single page application for a fictional pizzeria built with a combination of React, CSS, HTML for the front-end, and Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end. 

Features include:
● Being able to use the menu to filter options based on size and cost.
● Add pizzas to a cart or just order one and head straight to checkout.
● Modify the amount of pizzas of the same type in the cart or remove them altogether.
● A confirmation page with all the order details before placing an order.
● A cart whose contents persist if the user leaves and returns to the site.
